1) Plug in the Pi

2) Connect it to the router through a hardwired ethernet cable

3) Find you Pi's IP address

$ sudo nmap -sP <your IP>/24

4) SSH into the PI and provide password when prompted

$ ssh pi@<pi's ip address>

5) Navigate to wpa-supplicant config info

$ sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

6) Add this to the bottom of the file (filling in necessary data)

network={
    ssid="network-name"
    psk="network-password"
}

7) Disconnect from ethernet and reboot

8) Sometimes when you SSH into the Pi now there are RSA key problems if so
	1) Delete old key
		$ ssh-keygen -R <Old Pi IP address>

	2) Look up new IP 
		See step 3

	3) SSH into Pi using new IP
		$ ssh pi@<new UP from step 8.2>
