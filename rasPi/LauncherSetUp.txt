How to set up the launcher code:
Edit: launcher.sh seems like it might be useless as you can do below:

1. Edit the file  with sudo nano /etc/rc.local

2. Add line -> python readFromSerial.py &

If this doesn't work, then add the line -> python launcher.sh &
- This will run the code on boot but if we want to re run the code if 
there is an issue then we will need to figure out how to restart the Pi from
the readFromSerial.py code
